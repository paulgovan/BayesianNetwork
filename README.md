# RiskNetwork
Risk network modeling and analysis

# Features
* Create interactive risk network models in the cloud
* Learn the structure of your network with powerful structural learning algorithms
* Learn the paramaters of your network with effective paramater learning methods
* Measure the importance of connections in your network with node and network measures
* Generate data from your network and export to your favorite app

# Overview
RiskNetwork is a [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com) web application for risk network modeling and analysis, powered by the excellent [bnlearn](http://www.bnlearn.com) and [networkD3](http://christophergandrud.github.io/networkD3/) packages. While this app was developed specifically for risk networks, it can also be used for general [Bayesian Network](http://singapore.cs.ucla.edu/LECTURE/lecture_sec1.htm) modeling and analysis. To learn more about our project, see this [publication](http://oaktrust.library.tamu.edu/handle/1969.1/153492).

# Getting Started
